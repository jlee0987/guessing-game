# 🎲 Guessing Game
### Description
This Java program generates a random number between 0-100 and allows a user to guess this number. The user is allowed a maximum of 5 tries. <br/>


### Specs
▪    The program should allow a user to input their guess.<br/>

▪    The absolute value of the difference (diff) between the number and the guess is 0, then the user has guessed the correct number. <br/><br/>
➝ If diff ≥ 50 - guess is too high/low<br/>
➝ If 30 ≤ diff <50 - guess is high/low<br/>
➝ If 15 ≤ diff < 30 - guess is moderately high/low<br/>
➝ If 0 < diff <15 - guess is somewhat high/low<br/>
